### Install

```
npm install
```

### Build

npm run build
```

### Start

```
npm start

To build to JS run `npm run build:web` and then run a static server, like
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and go to `localhost:8000`. If you're using safari
you can simply open the `index.html` and tick
`Develop > Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions`.

To build to native run `npm run build:native` and run `npm run start:native`

The build system used is [bsb-native](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native).
